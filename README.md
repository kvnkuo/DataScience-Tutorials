# udacity-machine-learning

This repo contains my work in completing Udacity's Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree program.
The program consisted of 4 guided projects, and ended with an open-ended capstone project for which
I built a Airbnb Listing Price Prediction Model using linear regression.

#### Project 1: Boston Housing
An introductory exploration of linear regression to predict a continuous variable, in this example housing prices.

#### Project 2: Student Intervention
An exploration of logistic regression for classification tasks, in this example whether a student will pass or needs extra help.

#### Project 3: Customer Segmentation
Comparison of PCA (principal component analysis) vs ICA (independent component analysis) for segmenting a distributor's
customers into distinct types.

#### Project 4: Training a Smartcab
Training a car to follow the rules of the gridworld road using reinforcement learning. Check out `smartcab/agent.py`
for my implementation!

#### Capstone Project: Airbnb Price Prediction Model
An exploration of how regression models with different regularizations (lasso, elasticnet, and ridge) compare in the 
values of the parameters they learn. Check out the pdf of my write-up! My favorite visualization from the project:
